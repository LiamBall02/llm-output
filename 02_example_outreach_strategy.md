## Personalized Outreach Messages

Hi Amy,

I work as an editor for the Toy Talk Newsletter at ClickZ. I saw you were interested in our Toy Talk piece on the LEGO Ã— Nike Dunk â€” I'm glad Iâ€™m not the only one zooming in on those 1,180 pieces!

Your recent input on Richard Derrâ€™s post about the Moose Toys Ã— Mark Rober partnership really got me thinking: are collaborations like these really winning because of the collectible buzz, or because they show kids that fashion and engineering can be the same conversation?

Iâ€™m writing a short feature on that exact tensionâ€”limited-edition hype vs. lasting play value. If youâ€™ve got 15 minutes this week, Iâ€™d love to include a quote from a brand manager who actually ships products (and not just talks about them).

Best,
Your Name
