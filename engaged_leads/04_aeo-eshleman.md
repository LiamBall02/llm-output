## Personalized Outreach Messages

### Option 1: Technology Strategy Angle
Hi Susan,

I noticed you clicked through to Fospha twice from the Unofficially Shoptalk newsletter on April 1st - that level of engagement from an SVP of Product & Technology Strategy tells me you're thinking seriously about attribution technology.

Your work on AEO's "POS of the Future" shows you understand how to build retail technology that actually works. I'm curious about your perspective on connecting POS data with marketing attribution - it seems like the next logical step for comprehensive customer intelligence.

I'm working on a piece about how retail technology leaders are building attribution into their broader customer data strategy. Would love to include insights from someone who's actually implementing this at scale.

15 minutes this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 2: Product Management Focus
Hi Susan,

Your recognition as one of Chain Store Age's "Top Women in Retail Tech" caught my attention, especially given your recent engagement with Fospha's attribution technology.

As someone who's built product teams and technology strategy at AEO, you have a unique perspective on what makes attribution technology actually useful for retail teams. Most solutions are built by engineers for engineers - but you understand what product managers and marketers actually need.

I'm exploring how product leaders are approaching the attribution technology stack. Your experience bridging business needs with technical implementation would be invaluable.

Coffee or quick call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 3: Retail Innovation Leadership
Hi Susan,

Your LinkedIn activity around retail technology conferences (Shoptalk Barcelona, NRF Asia Pacific) and your engagement with Fospha suggest you're staying ahead of the attribution technology curve.

The fact that you clicked through to Fospha twice in one night tells me you're not just casually browsing - you're evaluating solutions. Given your role overseeing product and technology strategy at AEO, I imagine you're thinking about how attribution fits into the broader customer data ecosystem.

I'm writing about how retail technology leaders are building comprehensive customer intelligence platforms. Your perspective on integrating attribution with POS, loyalty, and customer data would be incredibly valuable.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about where you see attribution technology heading?

Best,
[Your Name]
