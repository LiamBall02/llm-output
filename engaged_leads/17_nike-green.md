## Personalized Outreach Messages

### Option 1: Attribution Technology Angle
Hi Max,

I noticed your engagement with Fospha content through the Unofficially eTail newsletter back in February. Your multiple clicks within minutes suggest you're actively evaluating attribution solutions—which makes perfect sense given Nike's unique scale challenges.

Most attribution platforms break down when you're measuring $50B+ in global revenue across 190+ countries. The traditional models that work for smaller brands simply can't handle Nike's complexity of brand campaigns, performance marketing, retail partnerships, and athlete sponsorships.

I'm working on a piece about how global athletic brands are reinventing marketing measurement at scale. Your perspective on connecting Nike's iconic brand investments to measurable performance outcomes would be invaluable.

### Option 2: Industry Leadership Focus
Hi Max,

Your interest in the Fospha eTail Palm Springs event caught my attention. As someone leading performance marketing at the world's largest athletic brand, you're solving measurement challenges that maybe 10 other companies globally face.

The intersection of Nike's massive brand campaigns ("Just Do It") with measurable performance outcomes is fascinating. Most brands are either brand-focused or performance-focused, but Nike has to excel at both simultaneously.

I'm exploring how performance marketing leaders at global scale are approaching attribution and measurement. Your insights on bridging the brand-performance gap at Nike's scale would be incredibly valuable for the industry.

Coffee or quick call to discuss?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 3: Global Scale Measurement
Hi Max,

Nike's performance marketing challenges are in a league of their own. While most brands worry about measuring across a few channels, you're connecting brand campaigns, athlete sponsorships, retail partnerships, and performance marketing across 190+ countries.

Your engagement with attribution technology content suggests you're thinking about next-generation measurement approaches. The traditional last-click models that work for smaller brands obviously can't capture Nike's complex customer journey.

I'm researching how global brands are solving enterprise-scale attribution challenges. Your perspective on what works (and what doesn't) at Nike's scale would be incredibly insightful.

Quick call this week to discuss the unique challenges of performance marketing at global scale?

Best,
