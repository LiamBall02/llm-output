## Personalized Outreach Messages

### Option 1: Attribution Technology Angle
Hi Ravindra,

I noticed you clicked through to Fospha from Unofficially Shoptalk back in March—at 4:59 AM, no less. That's the kind of dedicated research time that tells me you're serious about solving attribution challenges.

Your background in omnichannel product management puts you in a unique position to understand why traditional analytics fail modern retail. Between checkout optimization, returns processing, and loyalty systems, you're seeing the full customer journey that most attribution tools miss.

I'm writing about how product managers are becoming the bridge between AI/ML capabilities and practical retail applications. Your perspective on translating attribution technology into actual customer experience improvements would be invaluable.

Quick call this week to discuss?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 2: Product Management Strategy
Hi Ravindra,

Your LinkedIn profile caught my attention—10+ years bridging Health Tech, Communications, and Retail gives you a perspective most product managers lack. That cross-industry experience is exactly what retail needs right now.

I'm particularly interested in how you approach omnichannel product strategy at AEO. The challenges of connecting checkout, returns, loyalty, and customer care systems while maintaining a seamless experience seem incredibly complex.

Working on a piece about how product managers are reimagining customer journey optimization. Your insights on building systems that actually work across all touchpoints would be perfect.

15 minutes to chat about your approach?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 3: AI/ML in Retail Focus
Hi Ravindra,

Your combination of AI/ML expertise and hands-on retail product management is rare. Most people are either technical or business-focused—you're clearly both.

I'm exploring how product managers are becoming the missing link in retail AI/ML implementation. The gap between what's technically possible and what actually improves customer experience is huge, and PMs like you are the ones solving it.

Your work on data analytics, risk assessment, and customer systems at AEO would provide perfect insights for this piece. How are you thinking about AI/ML applications in attribution and customer journey optimization?

Coffee or quick call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
