### Option 1: Global Marketing Measurement Angle
Hi Jennifer,

I noticed you clicked through to Jamie Bolton's post about marketing measurement fragmentation from the ClickZ Underwear newsletter back in April. As Global Marketing Manager at Calvin Klein Underwear, you're dealing with some of the most complex attribution challenges in marketing.

Managing campaigns across 50+ countries, multiple currencies, and different digital ecosystems—while proving ROI for Calvin Klein's $9.3B global retail sales—requires sophisticated measurement solutions. Jamie's point about unified ROAS being 45% more effective than DTC-only metrics must resonate with your global coordination challenges.

I'm exploring how marketing leaders like you are solving attribution at the international scale. Your perspective on measuring cross-channel impact across diverse global markets would be invaluable.

15 minutes this week to discuss?

### Option 2: Intimate Apparel Marketing Focus
Hi Jennifer,

Your engagement with Fospha's content about marketing measurement fragmentation caught my attention. The intimate apparel space presents unique challenges—privacy-sensitive consumers, subscription behaviors, and the need to prove ROI across Calvin Klein's global footprint.

As Global Marketing Manager, you're navigating attribution challenges that most marketers never face: proving the effectiveness of campaigns across cultures, currencies, and completely different digital ecosystems. The privacy-first approach required for intimate apparel adds another layer of complexity.

Writing a piece on how global brands are adapting their measurement strategies for privacy-sensitive categories. Your insights on balancing effectiveness with privacy across international markets would be incredibly valuable.

Coffee or quick call this week?

Best,

### Option 3: Cross-Channel Global Strategy
Hi Jennifer,

As Global Marketing Manager at Calvin Klein, you face a fascinating challenge: coordinating campaigns across markets where TikTok dominates in the US, WeChat rules in China, and Instagram spans globally—all while proving unified ROI.

Your click-through to Jamie Bolton's post about unified ROAS suggests you're thinking about measurement beyond traditional geographic silos. The challenge of proving how a New York campaign drives sales in Tokyo, or how European influencer partnerships impact US subscriptions, requires sophisticated attribution.

I'm exploring how marketing leaders are solving attribution challenges at the global scale. Your perspective on measuring cross-channel impact across diverse international markets would be invaluable.

Would love to discuss over coffee this week.

Best,
