## Personalized Outreach Messages

### Initial LinkedIn Message:

Hi Debbie,

I noticed you engaged with our CommerceNext coverage on attribution analytics—timely given American Eagle's European expansion plans!

Your role in international ecommerce puts you at the center of one of retail's biggest challenges: measuring campaign effectiveness across borders, currencies, and consumer behaviors. The attribution complexity alone must be fascinating.

I'm working on a piece about how international ecommerce managers are solving cross-border analytics challenges. Would you be open to a brief conversation about the unique measurement hurdles you're seeing as AEO expands globally?

I'd love to include insights from someone actually executing international expansion (not just theorizing about it).

Best,
[Your Name]

### Follow-up Message (if positive response):

Thanks for being open to chat, Debbie!

I'm particularly interested in:
- How attribution models change when tracking customers across time zones and currencies
- The biggest surprises you've encountered in European market research
- Whether American Eagle's brand messaging translates directly or requires localization

Would 15 minutes next Tuesday or Thursday work? Happy to work around your schedule.

Looking forward to learning from your experience,
[Your Name]
