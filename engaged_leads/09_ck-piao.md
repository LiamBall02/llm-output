## Personalized Outreach Messages

### Option 1: Marketing Measurement Technology Angle
Hi Meisha,

I noticed you clicked through to Jamie Bolton's post about marketing measurement fragmentation from the ClickZ Underwear newsletter back in April. As Deputy CEO of Calvin Klein Underwear, you're sitting at the intersection of some of the most complex attribution challenges in retail.

The intimate apparel space is particularly challenging—privacy-sensitive consumers, multi-channel journeys, and the need to prove ROI across Calvin Klein's $2.54B international revenue. Jamie's point about unified ROAS being 45% more effective than DTC-only metrics must resonate with your measurement challenges.

I'm exploring how leaders like you are solving attribution at scale within multi-brand portfolios like PVH. Your perspective on measuring cross-channel impact across different markets and consumer segments would be invaluable.

15 minutes this week to discuss?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 2: International Market Complexity Focus
Hi Meisha,

Your background spanning Taiwan and South Korea, combined with Calvin Klein's significant Asia-Pacific presence, gives you a unique perspective on international marketing measurement challenges.

I saw your engagement with Fospha's content about marketing fragmentation—it's exactly the kind of challenge that multiplies when you're measuring across markets from Seoul to New York. The attribution models that work in the US often break down completely in Asian digital ecosystems.

Writing a piece on how global brands like Calvin Klein are adapting their measurement strategies for international markets. Your insights on navigating these complexities would be incredibly valuable.

Coffee or quick call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 3: Multi-Brand Portfolio Strategy
Hi Meisha,

As Deputy CEO within PVH Corp's $8.6B portfolio, you face a fascinating challenge: proving how Calvin Klein Underwear's marketing drives results not just for your division, but potentially across Tommy Hilfiger and the broader brand ecosystem.

Your click-through to Jamie Bolton's post about unified ROAS suggests you're thinking about measurement beyond traditional silos. The halo effects between intimate apparel and fashion brands are particularly complex to track and optimize.

I'm exploring how senior executives are solving attribution challenges at the portfolio level. Your perspective on measuring cross-brand impact and optimizing for unified growth would be invaluable.

Would love to discuss over coffee this week.
