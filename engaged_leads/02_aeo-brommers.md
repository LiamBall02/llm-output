## Personalized Outreach Messages

### Option 1: Attribution Technology Angle
Hi Craig,

I saw you clicked through to Fospha from the Unofficially Shoptalk newsletter back in April. As someone who's been tracking how retail CMOs are solving the Gen Z attribution puzzle, I'm curious about your perspective.

Your "Unsubscribed" store concept at Ross Park Mall is fascinating—it's exactly the kind of experiential retail that makes traditional attribution models completely inadequate. How are you measuring the impact of those "slow down and hang out" moments on actual purchase behavior?

I'm working on a piece about how established brands like AEO are reinventing attribution for the TikTok generation. Would love to include insights from a CMO who's actually solving this challenge at scale.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 2: Creator Commerce Strategy
Hi Craig,

Your LinkedIn engagement around creator partnerships and authentic brand building caught my attention. As CMO of the #1 jeans brand for Gen Z, you're sitting at the epicenter of the creator commerce revolution.

I'm particularly interested in how you balance creator authenticity with brand consistency—especially when your audience is as discerning as Gen Z. The sports marketing approach you liked from E.L.F. Beauty (creating access vs. just promoting products) seems to align with AEO's strategy.

Writing a feature on how retail CMOs are scaling creator partnerships without losing brand identity. Your perspective on navigating this balance would be invaluable.

15 minutes this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Option 3: Retail Innovation Focus
Hi Craig,

The "Unsubscribed" store concept is brilliant. In a world where everyone's trying to speed up commerce, you're literally telling customers to slow down and hang out. That takes serious conviction from a CMO.

Your background spanning Gap, Calvin Klein, and now AEO gives you a unique perspective on how retail marketing has evolved. I'm exploring how experienced CMOs are adapting traditional brand building for the TikTok generation.

Would love to discuss how you're thinking about the intersection of physical spaces, digital engagement, and authentic brand experiences. The Gen Z playbook seems to be completely different from what worked even 5 years ago.

Coffee or quick call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
