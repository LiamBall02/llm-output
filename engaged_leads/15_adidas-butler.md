## Outreach Strategy Framework

### Approach 1: Brand Communications Innovation
**Subject**: "Revolutionizing Horizontal Brand Attribution at Scale - adidas Case Study"

"Hi Grant,

I noticed your engagement with Fospha's platform on January 1st - perfect timing for strategic planning! Your role in horizontal brand communications at adidas puts you at the center of one of the most complex attribution challenges in sports marketing.

Your progression from digital partner operations to brand communications, combined with your leadership in Progressive Soles ERG, gives you a unique perspective on measuring both brand impact and inclusive marketing effectiveness.

I'd love to share how other global sportswear brands are using Fospha to:
- Unify attribution across all horizontal brand touchpoints
- Measure the incremental impact of DEI-focused campaigns
- Optimize cross-platform performance in real-time

Given your background in business information systems and your hands-on experience with adidas' digital ecosystem, I think you'd find our approach particularly compelling.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how Fospha could amplify your horizontal brand communications strategy?

Best regards,
[Your name]"

### Approach 2: DEI + Performance Marketing Synergy
**Subject**: "Measuring What Matters: DEI Campaign Attribution for Progressive Brands"

"Hi Grant,

Your dual role as Assistant Manager of Horizontal Brand Communications and Events Co-Chair of Progressive Soles ERG caught my attention - you're uniquely positioned at the intersection of brand performance and inclusive marketing.

As someone who's navigated from digital operations to brand strategy, you understand that measuring the true impact of DEI-focused campaigns requires sophisticated attribution modeling. Traditional tools often miss the nuanced ways inclusive messaging drives brand affinity and long-term loyalty.

I'd love to discuss how Fospha helps progressive brands like adidas:
- Quantify the incremental value of inclusive marketing campaigns
- Track cross-generational engagement with DEI-focused content
- Optimize spend allocation between performance and brand-building initiatives

Your experience with the adidas Future High Potential Program and your engineering background suggest you'd appreciate our data-driven approach to solving these complex attribution challenges.

Interested in a brief conversation about how measurement innovation can amplify your DEI impact?

Best,
[Your name]"

### Approach 3: Peer-to-Peer Innovation Exchange
**Subject**: "From Intern Hackathon Winner to Attribution Innovation - A Quick Chat?"

"Hi Grant,

I was impressed by your journey from winning the adidas Intern Hackathon to leading horizontal brand communications - that progression from innovation challenge to strategic execution is exactly the mindset that drives breakthrough marketing measurement.

Your January 1st engagement with Fospha suggests you're already thinking strategically about 2025 planning. Given your experience building promotional content that generated 564K+ engagement views and your current focus on horizontal brand communications, I think you'd find our attribution approach fascinating.

We're working with several global sportswear brands to solve the exact challenges you face:
- Measuring cross-platform brand campaign effectiveness
- Optimizing spend allocation across diverse consumer segments
- Proving ROI of inclusive marketing initiatives

Your unique combination of technical background (Business Information Systems), operational experience, and brand communications expertise makes you an ideal person to evaluate our platform.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how attribution innovation could amplify your brand communications impact?

Looking forward to connecting,
[Your name]"
